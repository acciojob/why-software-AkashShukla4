	<h1> Why I want to become a developer? </h1>

	<p>I've always had a knack for solving problems and I feel that software does just that. An important part of being a software developer is continuing your education. There are always new tools to acquire and better ways of developing software. Software developers need to spend a considerable amount of time keeping up to date with the latest news and developments in their industry so that they can create the best possible products. </p>
